# Classification-Model
In this project, I was given a Game of Thrones dataset to analyze and build a predictive model on a binary response variable of whether the character would be alive or would die after the next GOT novel comes out. 

This project includes feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development. 

The model types included in this project are:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNN)
- Classification Trees
- Random Forest (Classification)
- Gradient Boosted Models (GBM)

I also tuned some of these models with the intent to build a better predictive model. 

This project was very challenging but I learned so much!
